## This repo  contains the Named Entity recognition task on Indic language dataset.
Currently I have added a basic working notebook implementation of NER on very small dataset.  This repo is beginner friendly. I will keep updating this repo with many new techniques and tutorials about NER on Indic Languages. So stay tuned. 

 ## Guidelines
 Since most of the instructions are already given in the notebook, I am not considering of writing any tutorials about the implemented notebook. Please reach out to me or create a PR if you have any doubts about the same.
